Edgware Radio Club prototype
----------------------------

Introduction
------------
This is a simple protoype website for Edgware Radio club.  
The primary target audience are current members of the Radio Club and also people who might
want to join the radio club in the future, from complete beginners in radio operating to 
experts.


The UX 
-------
I used Figma to design the wireframes for each page and these can be found in the UX folder.

User stories: 
i) The website is used to showcase the band showing some of their highlights.
ii)  The band members short biographies are available for fans to see.
iii)  The band wanted a way for fans to contact them easily so the contact form is essential.
iv) The band wanted a videos page so that fans could see some of their performances over the years.

Band planning project 1 wireframe and notes added as separate pdf file to project showing initial plans of user
interface and includes my notes on adaptations listed below.

My homepage
-------------

I started by setting up the nav elements using flexbox and then changed the colour picture to mono as 
the grey background was better suited to a mono picture.  The band is a 1960s style band so this seemed
more in line with trends.  I later decided to use a free background image from pixabay still staying with the mono theme.

I then added a menu - first I used flexbox and padded out the items.  However this looked very amateurish so I decided
to make my items go down the page, centering these, adding in a hover effect of a blue line underneath each item.  I then linked my pages together
using absolute filepaths.

My gallery page
---------------

This page was made up of a series of pictures showing past gigs for the band.
I created a responsive gallery showing pictures of the band from the past and present.

My Videos page
--------------

This page enabled the user to click on a video and view a past performance by the Monkees.
I embedded videos into this page from you tube.


My contact page
---------------
I created a very simple form for this page which would be easy to fill in.

Another feature idea for my website
-----------------------------------
If I had more time I would choose to put in a timeline for the band on a separate page.
The timeline would show events from the formation of the monkees to the present day.

Testing
-------
I tested each page as I built it and also tested each piece of functionality individually.
I also showed the website to my family and friends as I built it and asked for suggestions
from them as to how to improve it.
I checked that my website worked on different browsers and screen sizes.

Tests done were:
i) Check that my nav bar appeared on each page. I used a nav bar with a class of container to 
ensure that my nav bar showed in across the top of my screen in a flex container.
I started with my home page and then copied the code into each of my 5 pages.  Worked as expected.

ii) Next I worked on my hover effect for the nav bar.  I liked the blue line hover effect so
put this into my index page and found that it worked well with the white background.

iii)At this stage I had a plain white background on my home page which looked rather dull so I looked
on pixabay for other suitable backgrounds and found a grey mottled background which I then
put on my index page using a link to pixabay.  Once I had it working on the index page I then
copied the background to my other pages.  Worked as expected.

iv) I then decided to work on my footer.  I put in the links to font awesome and it worked as expected.

v)  I then put a photograph of the monkees and some text into my header page.  I spent some time getting
this right using a flex container and it showed up as expected.

vi) I copied my footer to my other pages and checked it worked as expected.

vii)  I then worked on the body of my contact page.  I decided to put in a light grey background
to contrast with the grey mottled background.  I checked that the form showed up on the page.  Worked
as expected.

viii)  I then showed my half completed website to friends and family.  It was clear that the footer
wasn't showing up as it should and I soon realised that the font awesome link was missing on 
all pages except the home page.  Fixed this and pages worked as expected.

ix)  I then completed work on my gallery page.  It took a while to get the images and text to line
up - using float and setting appropriate heights took a while, and I realised that it was important
that all the pictures were initially the same sort of size for the page to look good.  I was keen to 
get a clear image with crisp text at the side of each image.  I asked my friends and family to look 
at this page and they felt that it was clear and the pictures were crisp, with the text telling a 
short story.

x) Finally I completed work on my videos page.  I decided to use videos rather than mp3 files as 
these looked much better and my audience were able to see the videos and appreciate the performances
in a concert scenario.

xi) I then worked on getting the website to be responsive by adding in media queries.  These took some
time to get right - I got confused with min an max widths but eventually with the help of developers 
from codebar meetup I managed to sort this out.  I did a final check of my website with friends and 
family who complemented me on the layout and felt that it was good to go.  However this does not mean
that it was perfect - I have suggested a couple of improvements I could make to it below.


Deployment
----------

I deployed my project to github using a total of 11 commits for the full project.
My project was commited to the master branch.

Credits
-------
All videos were from youtube.
Photographs were from code institute assets on github.
Thanks to my friends and family who supported me throughout this project.
Special thanks to the developers at codebar and freecodecamp meetups whose help 
and advice proved invaluable and gave me lots of things to think about.
Finally thanks to my mentor who gave me good advice at the beginning, middle and 
end of the project, and encouraged me to work to given deadlines to produce
a quality front end for my website.
